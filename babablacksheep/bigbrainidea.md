one bright and sunny morning, xiao ming went to the supermarket.
he bought three fish, and a chicken.
he lugged the red plastic bag all the way home, oblivious to what was lying ahead of him.
he fished about his pockets to find a bunch of metal keys, jingled them and smirked ://.
"Hoho," he thought,"I gonna be able to cook a brilliant meal for wifey!"
Giggling, xiao ming allowed himself to roam in his fantasy of imagination.
But then, disaster struck.

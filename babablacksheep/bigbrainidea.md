one bright and sunny morning, xiao ming went to the supermarket.
he bought three fish, and a chicken.
he lugged the red plastic bag all the way home, oblivious to what was lying ahead of him.
he fished about his pockets to find a bunch of metal keys, jingled them and smirked ://.
"Hoho,"he thought "I am gonna be able to cook a brilliant meal for dear wifey!"
But then, just as he was grinning from ear to ear, disaster struck.
